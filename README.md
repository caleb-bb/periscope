# Periscope

Tools for analyzing running liveview processes.

## Installation

Periscope can be installed by adding `periscope` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:periscope, "~> 0.4.6"}
  ]
end
```

You may also want to add it to your `iex.exs` by adding `import Periscope`. This ensures that Periscope will be available in your terminal when you run your app locally.
